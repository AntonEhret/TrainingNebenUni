# Introduction to R Visualizations in Microsoft Power BI

GitHub Repository for the 03/15/2017 and 04/05/2017 Meetups titled "Introduction to R Visualizations in Microsoft Power BI". First held in [Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Dojo-Toronto/events/237952698/) and subsequently in [Redmond](https://www.meetup.com/data-science-dojo/events/237941790/).

These materials make extensive use of Microsoft's [Wide World Importers](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0) SQL Server 2016 sample database.

Additionally, the following are required to use the files for the Meetup:

* [Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45331)
* [The R programming language](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* The [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html), [lubridate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html), [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), [scales](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scales/index.html), and [qcc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qcc/index.html) packages.

While not required, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is highly recommended.
