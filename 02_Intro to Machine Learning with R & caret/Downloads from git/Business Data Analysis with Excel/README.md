# Intro to Business Data Analysis with Excel

GitHub Repository for the 03/08/2017 Meetup titled "[Business Data Analysis with Excel](https://www.meetup.com/data-science-dojo/events/236198327/)".

These materials make extensive use of the examples documented in the book "[Making Sense of Data](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Sense-Data-Donald-Wheeler/dp/0945320728/)" by Donald J. Wheeler. This book is highly recommended to all Data/Business Analysts interested in expanding the rigor of their analyses.
