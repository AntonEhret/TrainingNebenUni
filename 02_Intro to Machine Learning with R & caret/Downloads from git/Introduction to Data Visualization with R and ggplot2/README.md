# IntroDataVisualizationWithRAndGgplot2

The public GitHub repository for Data Science Dojo's webinar titled "An Introduction to Data Visualization with R and ggplot2". 

These materials make use of the data from Kaggle's [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition.

Additionally, the following are required to use the files for the Meetup:

* [The R programming language](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* While not required, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is highly recommended.
* The [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) package.
