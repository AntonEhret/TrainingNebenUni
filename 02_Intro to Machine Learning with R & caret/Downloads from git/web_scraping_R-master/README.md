# Automated Web Scraping in R

Letâ€™s imagine you would like to tap into news sources to analyze the events happening in Bitcoin or any in other topic area that frequently changes by the hour. These events could be analyzed to summarize the key changes or movements in Bitcoin, rate the overall sentiment of the recent discussions, capture important events, and so on. So you need a collection of recent Bitcoin events or news scraped every hour so that you can analyze these events.

This R script is an example of how to:
1. Write standard web scraping commands in R
2. Filter timely data based on time diffs
3. Analyze or summarize key information in the text
4. Send an email alert of the results of your analysis.
