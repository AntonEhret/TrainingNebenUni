# The use of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a 
# powerful technique for enhancing the information/signal contained
# within our document-frequency matrix. Specifically, the mathematics
# behind TF-IDF accomplish the following goals:
#    1 - The TF calculation accounts for the fact that longer 
#        documents will have higher individual term counts. Applying
#        TF normalizes all documents in the corpus to be length 
#        independent.
#    2 - The IDF calculation accounts for the frequency of term
#        appearance in all documents in the corpus. The intuition 
#        being that a term that appears in every document has no
#        predictive power.
#    3 - The multiplication of TF by IDF for each cell in the matrix
#        allows for weighting of #1 and #2 for each cell in the matrix.

#
#        Also note that running the following code required approximately

# NOTE - The following code takes a long time to run. Here's the math.
#        We are performing 10-fold CV repeated 3 times. That means we
#        need to build 30 models. We are also asking caret to try 7 
#        different values of the mtry parameter. Next up by default
#        a mighty random forest leverages 500 trees. Lastly, caret will
#        build 1 final model at the end of the process with the best 
#        mtry value over all the training data. Here's the number of 
#        tree we're building:
#
#             (10 * 3 * 7 * 500) + 500 = 105,500 trees!

# On a workstation using 10 cores the following code took 28 minutes

# Time the code execution
# start.time <- Sys.time()

# We have reduced the dimensionality of our data using SVD. Also, the 
# application of SVD allows us to use LSA to simultaneously increase the
# information density of each feature. To prove this out, leverage a 
# mighty Random Forest with the default of 500 trees. We'll also ask
# caret to try 7 different values of mtry to find the mtry value that 
# gives the best result!
